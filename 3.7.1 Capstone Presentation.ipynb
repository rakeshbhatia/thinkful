    "First: Go out and find a dataset of interest. It could be from one of our recommended resources, some other aggregation, or scraped yourself. Just make sure it has lots of variables in it, including an outcome of interest to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second: Explore the data. Get to know the data. Spend a lot of time going over its quirks and peccadilloes. You should understand how it was gathered, what's in it, and what the variables look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third: Model your outcome of interest. You should try several different approaches and really work to tune a variety of models before using the model evaluation techniques to choose what you consider to be the best performer. Make sure to think about explanatory versus predictive power and experiment with both.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, here is the deliverable: Prepare a slide deck and 15 minute presentation that guides viewers through your model. Be sure to cover a few specific things:\n",
    "\n",
    "A specified research question your model addresses\n",
    "How you chose your model specification and what alternatives you compared it to\n",
    "The practical uses of your model for an audience of interest\n",
    "Any weak points or shortcomings of your model\n",
    "This presentation is not a drill. You'll be presenting this slide deck live to a group as the culmination of your work in the last two supervised learning units. As a secondary matter, your slides and / or the Jupyter notebook you use or adapt them into should be worthy of inclusion as examples of your work product when applying to jobs.\n",

    "Good luck!"
