This is a feature of neural networks that aren't given enough data for the number of features present. _Neural networks, in general, like_ a lot _of data_. You may also have noticed something also about neural networks: _they can take a_ long _time to run_. Try increasing the layer size by adding a zero. Feel free to interrupt the kernel if you don't have time...\n",

    "Also note that we created bools for artist's name but left them out. Both of the above points are the reason for that. It would take much longer to run and it would be much more prone to overfitting."

    "Now, before we move on and let you loose with some tasks to work on the model, let's go over the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "We included one parameter: hidden layer size. Remember in the previous lesson, when we talked about layers in a neural network. This tells us how many and how big to make our layers. Pass in a tuple that specifies each layer's size. Our network is 1000 neurons wide and one layer. (100, 4, ) would create a network with two layers, one 100 wide and the other 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "How many layers to include is determined by two things: computational resources and cross validation searching for convergence. It's generally less than the number of input variables you have.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also set an alpha. Neural networks like this use a regularization parameter that penalizes large coefficients just like we discussed in the advanced regression section. Alpha scales that penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we'll discuss the activation function. The activation function determines whether the output from an individual perceptron is binary or continuous. By default this is a 'relu', or 'rectified linear unit function' function. In the exercise we went through earlier we used this binary function, but we discussed the _sigmoid_ as a reasonable alternative. The _sigmoid_ (called 'logistic' by SKLearn because it's a 'logistic sigmoid function') allows for continuous variables between 0 and 1, which allows for a more nuanced model. It does come at the cost of increased computational complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to learn more about these, study [activation functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function) and [multilayer perceptrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron). The [Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) book referenced earlier goes into great detail on the linear algebra involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could also just test the models with cross validation. Unless neural networks are your specialty cross validation should be sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the other parameters and their defaults, check out the [MLPClassifier documentaiton](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier.html#sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier)."

    "I noticed that increasing the visible layer size even by as much as tenfold (from 100 to 1000) did not increase the accuracy at all. Additionally, changing the alpha parameter had no effect on the accuracy. However, increasing the second layer size to 50 and adding a third layer of size 10 did result in a small improvement in accuracy. Interestingly, decreasing the visible layer size to 500 and increasing the hidden layer sizes tenfold to 500,100 resulted in a huge decrease in accuracy, indicating that perhaps more of an increase in the hidden layers is required to offset the decrease in the visible layer size. Decreasing the visible layer size further to 100 while increasing the hidden layer sizes to 1000,500 finally enabled me to reproduce a similar accuracy to what I had with a visible layer size of 1000."
