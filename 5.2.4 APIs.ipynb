    "Looking at Amazon's robots.txt file (or Twitter's, or Facebook's), you may be surprised to see them prohibit or severely restrict scraping.  Aren't there a lot of projects online using Twitter data?  And how dare they keep all that delicious, delicious information to themselves?  But before you start setting `'ROBOTSTXT_OBEY' = False`, read on!\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of The Big Websites (Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc) have APIs that allow you to access their information programmatically without using webpages.  This is good for both you and the website.  With an API, you can ask the server to send you only the specific information you want, without having to retrieve, filter out, and discard the CSS, HTML, PHP, and other code from the website.  This minimizes demand on the server and speeds up your task.  \n",
    "\n",
    "APIs typically include their own throttling to keep you from overloading the server, usually done by limiting the number of server requests per hour to a certain number.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To access an API, you will usually need an API key or token that uniquely identifies you.  This lets the company or service providing the API keep an eye on your usage and track what you are doing.  Different API keys can also be associated with different levels of authorization and access, so they work as a data security measure.  Keys or tokens may also be set to expire after a certain amount of time or number of uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anatomy of an API\n",
    "\n",
    "*Access*- You request a key.  Your program provides the key with each API call, and it determines what your program can do in the API.  \n",
    "*Requests*- Your program requests the data you want with a call to the API.  The request will be made up of a method (type of query, using language defined by the API) and parameters (refine the query).  \n",
    "*Response*- The data returned by the API, usually in a common format such as JSON that your program can parse.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The specific syntax for each of these elements, and the format of the response, will vary from API to API.  In addition, APIs vary widely in their level of documentation and ease of use.  Before diving too deeply into an API-scraping project, do some judicious googling and if you see a lot of posts [like this one](https://mollyrocket.com/casey/stream_0029.html) consider going elsewhere.  Not all websites put their APIs front-and-center (did you know there are APIs for [NASA](https://api.nasa.gov/), [Marvel Comics](http://developer.marvel.com/), and [Star Wars](https://swapi.co/)?) so google will be your friend there as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basics of API Queries: Wikipedia's API\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of using an API sounds a lot like scraping (make request, get response), but with an occasional added authorization layer.  Scrapy can handle authorization, so we can use it to access APIs too.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, the first API we'll pull from is [Wikipedia's](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page), which doesn't require an authorization key.  Aside from needing to master the API's language, you'll find that using scrapy with an API is very similar to using scrapy on a website.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to know what other entries on Wikipedia link to the [Monty Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python) page.  To do this, we can build a query using the [Wikipedia API Sandbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:ApiSandbox).  Someone who is comfortable with the MediaWiki API syntax wouldn't need to use the sandbox, but for beginners it is very handy.  Note that API queries are nothing like SQL queries in syntax, despite their shared name.\n",
    "\n",
    "The query we will use looks like this:\n",
    "`https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&format=xml&prop=linkshere&titles=Monty_Python&lhprop=title%7Credirect`\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break that down into it's components:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `w/api.php`\n",
    "    * Tells the server that we are using the API to pull info, rather than scraping the raw pages.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "* `action=query`   \n",
    "    * We want information from the API (as opposed to changing information in the API)  \n",
    "    \n",
    "* `format=xml`  \n",
    "    * Format the return in xml- then we will parse it with xpath  \n",
    "    \n",
    "* `prop=linkshere`  \n",
    "    * We are interested in which pages link to our target page \n",
    "    \n",
    "* `titles=Monty_Python`  \n",
    "    * The target page is the Monty Python page.  Note that we used the exact name of the wikipedia page (Monty_Python).  \n",
    "    \n",
    "* `lhprop=title`  \n",
    "    * From those links, we want the title of each page  \n",
    "    \n",
    "* `redirect`  \n",
    "    * We also want to know if that link is a redirect  \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax of the MediaWiki API is based on php, thus the inclusion of `?` and `&` in the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "For most of the query elements, we could have passed multiple arguments.  For example, we could request the URL as well as the title of the linking pages, or asked for all the pages that link to Monty_Python and to Monty_Python's_Flying_Circus.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A query like this highlights why APIs are so handy.  Without an API, to find out the name of every page on Wikipedia that links to the Monty Python page we would have to scrape every single one of the 5,000,000+ articles in the English-language Wikipedia.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't done so already, click on the query link above and see what it returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use Scrapy for API calls\n",
    "\n",
    "For some API calls, scrapy would be overkill.  If you know that your query can be answered in one response, then you don't need scrapy- you can use the `requests` library to make your API call and a library like `lxml` to parse the return.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Wikipedia API, however, will only return ten items at a time in response to a query.  This sort of limitation is common to APIs to avoid overwhelming the server.  We can use scrapy to iterate over query results the same way that we iterated over the pages of the EverydaySexism website. \n",

    "We can see that gsw (Golden State Warriors) had the most individual players active during this stretch, meaning they played two games and also went deep into their roster, utilizing a lot of their players. This makes sense, as the Warriors are known to play their bench players quite a lot. Most of the other teams did not seem to go too deep into their rosters, utilizing less bench players. It also appears that chi (Chicago Bulls) was the only team to play just a single game during this period."
