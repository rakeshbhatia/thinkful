    "## **The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, \"Give In to Your Anger,\" isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, \"Together We Can Rule the Galaxy.\" They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the \"Anger\" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the \"Together\" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that \"Anger\" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used.**"

They send two envoys, Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu, to four friendly and four unfriendly planets respectively, with the goal of promoting favorable feelings toward the Jedi. Upon their return, the envoys learn that Jar Jar was much more effective than Windu: Over 75% of the people surveyed said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Jar Jar, while only 65% said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Windu. This makes Windu angry, because he is sure that he had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet. The Jedi choose Jar Jar to be their representative in the future.**"

To fix this issue, I would compare job satisfaction by worksite, as opposed to collectively, as a whole. Those countries where there are no Human Resources employees can be eliminated from the survey."

When grading the test, the teacher finds that students who took Version B scored higher than students who took either Version A or Version C.

    "The problem here lies in the way the tests were distributed. Since Version B was in the middle stack, many students filling up the interior seats of the lecture hall took Version B of the exam. Many students who were sitting at or near the ends of each row probably took Version A or Version C. These areas are much easier for the teacher to monitor, as opposed to the more internal seats. Thus, it would be more likely for the teacher to curb cheating for Version A and Version C of the exam. To resolve this, I would randomly shuffle all versions of the exam and mix them together into a single stack before distributing them."
